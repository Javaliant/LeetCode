# [Hamming Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/description/)

**Challenge:** Given two integers `x` and `y` calculate the Hamming distance.

The [Hamming Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

**Output:** An integer representing the Hamming distance.

**Specifications:**
* 0 ≤ x, y < 2<sup>31</sup>

**Example:**
```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
